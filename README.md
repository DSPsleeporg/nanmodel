### Description
The largest file CodeRev is divided into Basic, Fig1, 2, 3, 4, 5, FigS1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7. As the name suggests, these files contains all coded necessary for generating figures in this paper. 

##### Basic
This file contains CSV files (CodeRev/Basic/CSV) for all models used in this study, calculation of trajectory for all types of models used in this study, and the code used for choosing the representative parameter set. Both in the file "Original" and "Revised", inside the file "anmodel", codes describing the models are stored. Most of the simulations conducted in this study are using codes in the folder "Original", except for some revised models. All simulations are conducted under the condition that the reversal potential is constant, except for simulations using codes in "Revised" folders, where the reversal potential of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ change dynamically and are dependent on intracellular and extracellular Na+, K+ and Ca2+, respectively. 
Codes used for calculating the network dynamics are stored (CodeRev/Basic/Network). 
In the "anmodel" file (CodeRev/Basic/Original/anmodel), 6 files are stored. To run a parameter search, you can type "python search.py" to the terminal. Here are the descriptions of each file.

__init__.py: module for importing all files for parameter search
analysis.py: module for analysing and classifying the wave pattern
channels.py: module for storinig formulation for all channels incorporated in the models used in this study
models.py: module for solving ordinary differential equations in the models
params.py: module for storing parameters (constants) in the models
search.py: module for running the parameter search

In the "Revised" file (CodeRev/Basic/Revised), 6 files are stored (similar to "Original" file described above), and this is used for running the revised models used in the study, which took account the dynamics of intracellular and extracellular Na+, K+, and Ca2+ to calculate the reversal potential.

PCA.ipynb: This is the code used for obtaining the representative parameter set.
